          Iâ€™m a passionate software developer with the innovative and creative mindset of an entrepreneur. I have experience building dynamic web applications with React, Javascript, Express, Python, Redux, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and CSS.
          I love the battle of developing an idea into existence and forging the bridge between conceptualization and a tangible, impactful product.
          Programming has been my outlet for problem-solving and creative expression.

          <p>
          Apart from coding, I enjoy playing golf, boxing, spending time with my dog and my family.
          My background in Business and Account Management has given me a unique perspective on the importance of a strong brand and the value of a great user experience.
          I'm able to combine my passion for programming with my business background to create a product that is both functional and beautiful.

            My inspiration behind creating this app was to create something that could bring people of similar hobbies and interest together.
            Whether it be that you just moved to a new city and want to meet new people or you just want to find a new hobby, this app is for you.
            Lets say you want to play a round of golf, you can create an event and other users can join you. You can also search for other events and
            try new things.
            This app is a great way to meet people and find new hobbies.
            I hope you enjoy using this app as much as I enjoyed creating it.
